    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest goal I have for myself going forward is staying in the honors program. A lot of people join the honors program their freshman year just to 
      live in the suites. To be honest, I was one of those people. But since being here, I've found more motivation to succeed. Dropping the honors program 
      just so I can take easy classes and glide through college without really trying would make me feel like a failure. I want my degree to mean something. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've never been the type of person to give up easily, and to me, dropping honors is the equivalent of giving up. My whole life I've been one of the “smart kids,” 
      which really just means that I put effort into the things that I do. I can't stop doing that now; if I did, then the last 19 years of my life would be completely pointless.
