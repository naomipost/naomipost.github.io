        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the time, I don't consider myself a creative person. For that reason, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to do for the synthesis project.
          I sat and thought about it for a while, and then remembered a video that had popped up in my YouTube recommended a few weeks ago: 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD13eq_Pmp8&t=2667s" style="color: blue;">Learn HTML in 1 Hour</a>.
          I watched the video and made a pointless silly "website," which was really just a few HTML files that linked together. I had a lot of fun doing that, but 
          I had no real reason to make a website, so I stopped messing around after a while and forgot about it until I was thinking of what project I wanted to make. 
          I decided it would be fun to challenge myself to build a real website from scratch. I also figured that considering that my major is computer science, it's 
          probably a good idea to get some experience creating websites.

          Also I apologize in advance if some of the pictures are not totally related to the chapter. I'm not the type of person who takes a lot of photos, so I really had to
          stretch to make the photos I have work.
