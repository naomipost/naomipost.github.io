    <h2>Changing Perspectives</h2>
    <p>
      My perspective on the Health and Well-Being pillar changed quite a bit over the semester. I always knew that there were at least two dimensions of well-being, 
      physical and mental, but I had no idea that there were eight more dimensions! This was a big shock to me, and made me realize that there are so many more important 
      parts of my life worth taking care of. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most interesting dimensions of well-being that I learned this semester was environmental well-being. I never really thought about how the environment can 
      influence your well-being, but it definitely is an important aspect. I never feel great after staying inside all day; even going on a walk to eat at Abel can lift my 
      mood a bit. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't focus on all 10 dimensions of well-being this semester, but two that I tried to focus on were physical and emotional well-being. Since I'm not doing cross 
      country anymore like I did in high school, I still wanted to make sure I was getting exercise and eating healthy. To get exercise, I joined the judo club, and I try 
      my best to eat healthy, but sometimes the only good thing on the menu is chicken strips. A few weeks ago my roommate and I cooked some steaks, which made me excited 
      for next year when I have an apartment. To improve my emotional well-being, my roommate and I visited the Nebraska Humane Society. Neither of us can have a cat at the 
      moment, but it was really fun to go and play with the cats there.
