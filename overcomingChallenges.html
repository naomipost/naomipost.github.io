    <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      One of the biggest challenges I experienced this first semester was my tendency to procrastinate. It's very easy for me to get distracted, especially since 
      this is the first time I'm on my own and have complete freedom over my life. In other words, my mom isn't around to nag me to get my work done. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I managed to overcome this challenge (at least, mostly) by utilizing the pomodoro method of studying that I learned during the first HI. When I need to get 
      something done, I go to the library, set a timer, and start studying. Another way that helped me to overcome this challenge is by picking the right music to 
      listen to while studying or doing homework. When I listen to music with words, I get too distracted. Listening to classical music is much better, but my favorite 
      music to listen to is the Doctor Who soundtrack. It doesn't have any words, and there are 15 seasons, so I'll never run out of music to listen to. It also helps me 
      avoid the urge to give up studying and watch Doctor Who instead, since I'm already listening to the sound track (which is incredible, by the way; Murray Gold is an amazing composer).

        <audio controls src="greatestStoryNeverTold.mp3"></audio>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">
          "The Greatest Story Never Told" from the Series 4
          soundtrack. This is easily my favorite song from 
          all 15 seasons of the show.
        </p>
        <audio controls src="doomsday.mp3"></audio>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">
          "Doomsday" from Series 2. This is another one of my favorites; it's such an iconic song from an iconic (although tragic) moment in the show.
