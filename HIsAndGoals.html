    <h2>HIs and SMART Goals</h2>
    <p>
      I love a good adventure, even if that adventure is a 40 minute walk around campus through the rain. Going out for each of the HIs was a fun way to change 
      up my week a bit, and I really enjoyed all three HIs of the semester (even if I didn't always enjoy writing the reflections). It was a nice change to get 
      out, explore a bit, and get to know the others in my peer mentoring group a bit better. I will apply the information I learned from each HI the same way that I wrote
      in my reflections: by using the pomodoro method of studying to limit procrastination, utilizing the practice rooms in the Westbrook Music Building to practice my flute, 
      and knowing that East Campus exists and taking advantage of the resources offered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SMART goals were also helpful to me. It's easy for me to lose direction in my life, but the SMART goals I made helped to keep me on track. When I 
      started to get bored, I thought about the SMART goals I made and what I could do to complete them instead of starting another TV show to binge. Even though 
      I ended up binging several TV shows anyway, I didn't feel guilty about it since I did end up completing my SMART goals. In the future, I plan to continue making 
      SMART goals for myself to give myself something to work for and give my life direction.
