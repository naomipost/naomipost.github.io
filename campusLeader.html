    <h2>Being a Campus Leader</h2>
    <p>
      To me, being a campus leader means positively contributing to the campus community. This can be achieved through many ways, whether it be lollipop moments or 
      becoming the ASUN president. The three pillars serve as guides for some of the most important things to keep in mind as a campus leader. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well-being is crucial to a person's success in life. If a person is struggling in any of the dimensions of well-being, they are going to have a hard time succeeding 
      at other aspects of their lives. It's a leader's job to encourage well-being for those around them. This could be done by example, or by encouraging others to join 
      clubs, head to the Rec, or spend some extra time studying. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Academic and professional development is another area that is important for success in college. A campus leader supports classmates and friends who might be struggling 
      with the material. A leader doesn't have to be someone who knows everything, just a person who can ask questions and knows how to get help. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a campus leader helps to foster a sense of community. The most important goal of a leader is making a positive impact on the community. Encouraging people 
      to be kind to each other makes the campus a better place to be. Promoting inclusivity and diversity helps to eliminate single stories, and in turn helps people to 
      respect each other and creates a positive atmosphere on campus.
